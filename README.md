# inventory-grpc
A microservice learning project focused on gRPC communication. It demonstrates service decomposition and interaction through gRPC APIs.  
  
Explore how to set up, run, and experiment with gRPC calls between independent services within a microservice architecture.  
  
Beyond basic service discovery, it also includes resiliency patterns: circuit breaker and retry.
